# Unit Testing with Mockito

This project aims to provide some examples of unit tests using Java, Junit and Mockito. The project as reference was used
base on the course [Mockito: Next-Level Java Unit Testing](https://www.udemy.com/course/mockito3/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=LongTail_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_77879424134_._ad_535397245863_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1007766171312_._li_1011759_._pd__._&matchtype=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxbefBhDfARIsAL4XLRozKLfXrn6Hfqauhjnw7toJJqojTPv3fqvLu__310v5H8LRgJ78kUgaAjAyEALw_wcB)
available on Udemy platform.

Note: Differently as presented over the course, I created the tests divided by classes representing each method to be tested.
